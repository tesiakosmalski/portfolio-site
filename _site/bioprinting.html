<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> <br />
4D bioprinting brings much excitement to the world of biomedical research and development. Similar to additive manufacturing and 3D bioprinting, 4D bioprinting employs materials, like plastics and cell constructs, to print new types of human tissue. 4D bioprinting, however, incorporates the fourth dimension, “time.” This fourth dimension is emulated by new types of programmable, printable biomaterials known as “smart materials.” Smart materials accommodate complex micro-environments inside the human body by reacting to various stimuli over time. By printing objects with a post-printed life, 4D bioprinting overcomes limitations in 3D bioprinting and advances regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug delivery.
As an agency specializing in lab and clinical services, most of our clients are life science companies somehow connected to the field of regenerative medicine. 4D bioprinting technology will clearly be of interest to our clients. We must more clearly understand client needs and their potential connections with 4D bioprinting technologies. This document offers a high level overview of active research in bioprinting, smart materials, and biomedical applications. This will help familiarize us with the language and landscape of 4D bioprinting so we can begin productive discussions with our customers.</p>

<p><strong>METHODS &amp; RESULTS</strong> <br />
A variety of sources were selected to understand the key touchpoints in 4D bioprinting research. To ensure source credibility, the following criteria were applied: consistent display in search results, diversity of authors, recency of publishing date, and greater numbers of citations. Though citation amounts were low, I selected a few highly relevant papers published within the last year.</p>

<p>The biomedical engineering librarian at the University of Minnesota recommended three top biomedical databases. These databases include Engineering Village, PubMed, &amp; Web of Science. All three were searched using five keywords: “4D bioprinting”, “3D bioprinting,” “applications,” “tissues,” “cells,” and “materials.” Depending on the combination of keywords, search results ranged from 15-47 items. The highest result number, 47, used only “4D bioprinting” as the keyword in the Web of Science database. The lowest number, 15 results, used  “4D bioprinting” and “cells/tissues”as keywords entered in Engineering Village. Additional searches were made in the open search of the university library and the Science Direct database. Four higher level, overview articles found in these searches were selected because they contained more accessible language.</p>

<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong> <br />
<strong>Bioprinting &amp; Bioinks</strong> <br />
4D bioprinting leverages material advances already made in 3D bioprinting. Bioprinting technologies employ smart biomaterials known as bioinks. Bioinks fabricate biocompatible tissue-mimicking constructs, or scaffolds. Scaffolds act as matrices that support growth for printed cells. The scaffolded cells then mature into functional cellular or tissue based vessels. The sophistication of these vessels can “enable precise fabrication of three-dimensions (3D) heterogeneous functional units for regenerative and developmental biology” (Arslan-Yildiz et al, 2016).</p>

<p><strong>Hydrogels</strong> <br />
The most commonly used bioinks are natural and synthetic polymers. Deemed one of the most reputable materials in bioprinting, hydrogels are a readily available biocompatible and biodegradable plastic. Hydrogels solid and aqueous states are easily programmed for changes in temperature and humidity. Their tailorable mechanical strength effectively emulates soft tissue (Lobo, 2019). Their cross-linkability and high swelling capacity resists physical, environmental forces (Rastogi, 2019). Alginate is an example of an increasingly popular hydrogel. It is a natural linear polysaccharide obtained from the wall of brown algae. It is applied in bioprinting due to its biocompatibility, promotion of cell proliferation, low price and the ability of fast gelation in calcium ion containing solutions. The major limitation of alginate derived hydrogels is mechanical stiffness for 3D bioprinting (Du, 2018).</p>

<p><strong>4D Bioprinting &amp; Smart Materials</strong> <br />
The 4D bioprinting story is rooted in the ability of  “smart materials” to overcome shortfalls of its 3D counterpart. 4D “smart materials” uniquely move, shape, and shift by memorizing translational paths between original and pre-programmed shapes when exposed to the appropriate stimulus (Rastogi, 2019).
Dynamic structures actually animate and self-transform depending on the nature of the microenvironment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smart materials are most commonly referred to as “materials that exhibit changes in physical or chemical properties in a controlled and functional manner upon exposure to an external stimulus, such as heat, moisture, light, magnetic field, or pH” (Tamay, et al, 2019).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, their biocompatibility with the human body is much higher and stronger with more sophisticated responses.</p>

<p>These materials have a series of responsive behaviors or “choreographies.” This material responsivity inspires several types of morphing or “deformations.” Deformations are specific to the type of material and stimuli. Morphing happens in the form of folding, shrinking, and swelling in response to temperature, humidity, light, pressure, and electrical force. One-way morphing does not return to its initial state. Two and multi-way can return to their original state but will do so based on different stimuli. These two trajectories put the 4D bioprint into a shape much more complex than a 3D bioprinter can compute or produce, thus mimicking the functions of tissue, organs, or other physiological structures. For example, this can take the form of lipid mixtures used to print liver tissue or synthetic cells that respond to light and act as neuronal transmissions (Yang. et al, 2019).</p>

<p><strong>Biomedical &amp; Regenerative Medicine Applications</strong> <br />
Tissue engineering has shown the most visible progress driven by 4D bioprinting. Smart materials can remember the translational paths of tissue with an accuracy that makes products safe for medical use. Muscle, stem, skin, nerve, and cardiac tissues have been created and safely applied as treatments in various ways. In terms of early and recurring research, bone tissue development has had the most extensive applications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The majority of [4D bioprinting] articles are focused on regenerative medicine applications such as improvement on bioprinted cartilage, orthopedics, bone tissue bioprinting, prevascularization on bone tissue constructs, and cartilage tissue engineering (Lobo, 2019).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simulating vascular tissues, necessary to build larger tissues like organs, has been a priority in 4D bioprinting. Tissue as complex as liver tissue demands a sophisticated system to distribute nutrients and oxygen and maintain cell viability. Ultimately, the most successful liver tissue was fabricated “using a decellularized extracellular matrix of the liver and a sacrificial material called Pluronic F-127, combined with immortalized mouse small cholangiocytes and a cancer cell line called HUH7” (Lobo, 2019.) Innovations have been made in matching the imperceptibly small vascular setups in the nervous system. Kirillova, et al, managed to break down HA cells, which are astrocytes in the nervous system. By modulating the calcium concentration in these cells, incredibly thin vessels were made. With the help of smart materials, the scientists were able to extend the cell coating, and thereby extend the life of the cell to 7 full days inside the body (Rastogi, 2019).</p>

<p>4D bioprinted containers, which are typically small self-folding cubes, are a canonical example  of use with drug containment and release (Zhang, et al, 2019). Pharmaceutical drugs can emit when the environment of the targeted location provides the correct stimulus. For example, thermoresponsive hydrogels can be used to create drug delivery systems. The Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogel demonstrated a swelling behavior that released an active compound upon thermal trigger at the first stage of the body’s inflammation (Jamaroz, 2018).</p>

<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong><br />
4D bioprinting is clearly progressing and doing a great deal of good in regenerative medicine. Thus, the technology should be added to our list of services for our clients. Because the technology is already so pervasive in the field, we should begin conversations with and assess the needs of our clients in osteopathic medicine. We can research and purchase the bioprinters, cells, hydrogels, and other biomaterials used in osteopathic bioprinting. We should next understand the research done in vascular systems. Improvements in replicated vascular systems are consistently being made and form the foundation for most biomedical bioprinting. These discoveries can easily be extended to all of our clients in regenerative medicine. Support for drug delivery systems should also be on the priority list. Pharmaceutical clients are generous with resources and form a significant part of our customer base.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong> <br />
There is a growing confidence in the 4D bioprinting boon. The technique can cure without intervention from humans, remedy with precise location mapping, and imitate natural anatomy by way of porosity, toughness, tensile and compressive strength, stiffness, and modulus.
Captivating the attention of the research and scientists across the world, 4D printing is escalating to face off the challenges of the medical domain with an affirmation to contribute towards diagnosing and curing the suffering of millions of people with its Intelligence (Rastogi, 2019).
Despite lingering issues with biocompatibility, researchers are making strides in the creation of multi-materials, materials that are truer hybrids of cells and polymers, are the secret to an even more accurate future for 4D Printing (Yang, et al, 2019). Our company should absolutely look towards this future by discussing the technology with our partners in regenerative medicine. By focusing on osteopathic medicine and subsequently research into vascular systems, we stay in tune with our clients needs and help them maintain prominent positions in a competitive biomedical future.</p>
